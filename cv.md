## Code example
Description:
> A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive? 

Return *true* if yes, *false* otherwise.

Solutions:
```
function hero(bullets, dragons){
  if (bullets >= dragons*2){
   return true;
    } else {
    return false;
    }
}
